## Abstract
This project explores the relationship between socioeconomic factors and school performance across the United States, focusing on the average ACT scores as a key indicator of academic achievement. The analysis combines multiple educational datasets, including variables such as median household income, unemployment rate, poverty levels, college education percentage, and free or reduced lunch rates. After cleaning and preparing the data‚Äîhandling missing values, normalizing variables, and encoding categorical factors such as funding status‚Äîthe study uses linear regression models to examine how these predictors influence student performance. The results indicate that socioeconomic conditions, particularly income level and access to educational resources, have a strong positive association with higher ACT averages, while poverty-related measures show an inverse effect. The findings highlight the persistent educational disparities driven by community-level economic differences and emphasize the need for targeted support programs to promote equity in academic outcomes.

**Columns include:**  
- `rate_unemployment`: County unemployment rate  
- `percent_college`: Percent of adults with college degrees  
- `percent_married`: Percent of children living with married parents  
- `median_income`: County median household income  
- `percent_lunch`: Percent of students receiving free/reduced lunch  
- `average_act`: School‚Äôs average ACT score  
- Additional school identifiers such as `state`, `zip_code`, `school_level`, `teachers_fte`, and `funding_status`.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- JupyterLab  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
- 
## üßπ Analysis
All data processing and analysis were completed in **Jupyter Notebook** using Python.  
Key steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed negative or invalid values in `percent_lunch` and `average_act`.
   - Encoded categorical variables such as funding status (`No` = 0, `Yes` = 1).
   - Handled missing values with mean imputation and NaN handling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized relationships among socioeconomic factors using pairplots, heatmaps and boxplots.
   - Examined distributions and outliers.

3. **Modeling**
   - Built multiple linear regression models to predict `average_act`.
   - Compared a full normalized model and a reduced model using R¬≤ and MAE metrics.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Compared model performance and identified the most influential predictors.

All code and outputs are available in the Jupyter Notebook file:

## üìà Results
- The **normalized model** achieved an **R¬≤ of 0.6228** and **MAE of 1.1411**, showing a moderately strong relationship between socioeconomic indicators and ACT performance.  
- Key predictors affecting ACT scores include **median income**, **college education rate**, and **percent lunch** (a proxy for poverty levels).  
- Schools in higher-income and higher-education areas tend to perform better on average.
